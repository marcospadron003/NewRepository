# NewRepository
This is a new repository for my Python class.
 Python is said to be the easiest language to learn but it was still somewhat challenging. 
 I enjoyed learning through using different resources like replit, coding bat and codewars.
 Its refreshing and a different point of view to use something other than the textbook to 
 learn from.
